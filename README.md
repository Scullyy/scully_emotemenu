# Keybinds

**Important Note:**

By default the configured keybinds in the *initial* scully_emotemenu.cfg will be the default keys, however once the keybinds are set for a player, they'll stay and editing the keybinds in the config will change them for new players only. Previous players can set their own keybinds within `Esc > settings > keybinds > fivem`.

# Emote Binds

Players can bind emotes by opening the keybinds sub menu. Each option within the sub menu is binded to a key within `Esc > settings > keybinds > fivem` that your players can change to their own preferred keys to play emotes.

# Custom Emotes

You can add custom emotes to the menu by using the `addEmoteToMenu` and `addEmotesToMenu` exports or events. If you want to add a whole new custom section to the emote options submenu you can also use the `addEmoteMenuOption` export or event.

# Additional Emote Options

<details>
<summary>NSFW</summary>
<br>

**Key:** `NSFW = true`
<br>

**Description:** NSFW emotes are any emote that wouldn't be considered safe for anyone under the age of 18 to see, if you don't run an 18+ community I suggest keeping the `EnableNSFWEmotes` config option as false which will disable all emotes with this added. You can also set `EnableNSFWEmotes` to `'limited'` which will make it so a state bag needs to be set so NSFW emotes can be used. Info on the export can be found [here](docs/statebags/allowNSFWEmotes.md) and I would personally suggest making it so the emotes can only be used when inside a house or apartment.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Gang</summary>
<br>

**Key:** `Gang = true`
<br>

**Description:** Gang emotes are emotes that can be used to identify your affiliation with a certain group, these emotes can be disrespectful to certain people or cause controversial topics to arise so a config option was added to prevent such a thing from happening which will disable all emotes with this added.
</details>

<details>
<summary>SocialMovement</summary>
<br>

**Key:** `SocialMovement = true`
<br>

**Description:** The social movement emotes are any kind of emote that represents a group who advocates for change in society such as the LGBTQ and BLM emotes in which their communities advocate for liberation, some communities might feel as if people will use them in an ironic manner or to troll which would be disrespectful and some servers might be based in countries where it is shunned due to their religion so a config option was implemented to respect both these communities and religious beliefs which will disable all emotes with this added.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Hide</summary>
<br>

**Key:** `Hide = true`
<br>

**Description:** If you would like to hide an emote from the menu and have it only accessible by commands, exports or events you can add this to the emote table.
</details>

<details>
<summary>BlockBinding</summary>
<br>

**Key:** `BlockBinding = true`
<br>

**Description:** If you would like to prevent a player from using the menu to bind a certain emote you can add this to the emote table. Keep in mind they can still bind using Cfx's `rbind` console command.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Auto</summary>
<br>

**Key:** `Auto = true`
<br>

**Description:** If you would like particles to automatically play you can add this to the PTFX table within the emote table, you will need to have the `EnableAutoPtfx` config enabled for this to work.
</details>

<details>
<summary>SkipRequest</summary>
<br>

**Key:** `SkipRequest = true`
<br>

**Description:** If you would like a shared emote to play without needing to request it you can add this to the emote table.
</details>

<details>
<summary>PedTypes</summary>
<br>

**Key:** `PedTypes = {'small_dogs', 'big_dogs', 'cats', 'birds', 'marine_mammals', 'rodents', 'land_mammals', 'aquatic_animals'}`
<br>

**Description:** If you would like an emote to require a certain ped type you can add this to the emote table.
</details>

<br>
